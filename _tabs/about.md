<p>Hi</p>
      <p>Sometimes I break things just to see how they fit back together. Other times I lose track of time in a book, solving hacking challenges, or a thought that refuses to end. Between wandering, writing, and chasing puzzles, I’m simply learning how to enjoy the chaos and the quiet in equal measure.</p>
