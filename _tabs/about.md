Hey everyone! I'm Aakash Kokate, a cybersecurity researcher, bug bounty hunter, and pentester.

In my free time, I enjoy playing chess and writing. When I'm not immersed in cybersecurity projects, you can find me playing CTF games on platforms like HacktheBox, TryHackMe, and OverTheWire. Don't forget to check out my cybersecurity newsletter

 and my blog on Medium https://medium.com/@GREEN51LV3R.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or discuss anything related to cybersecurity.
