When we ask Google about the shell, it simply defines it as 

> A computer program that exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other programs

In simpler terms, a shell is like a bridge between us and the computer, understanding and executing our commands. But why are we talking about shell? It's because we're about to embark on an intriguing adventure with it. Let's see if we can make it out unscathed. 

### Level Goal 

Getting into Bandit 26 from Bandit 25 should be a walk in the park, right? wrong! The shell for user Bandit 26 isn't your run-of-the-mill bin/bash; it's something else entirely. 
Our mission: Discover what it is, how it operates, and most importantly, how to break free from its clutches. 

Our journey begins with an SSH connection attempt to Bandit 26. However, to establish that connection, we need a key. We have a nifty SSH key hidden within one of the files in Bandit 25. So first things first, we grant the file all the permissions it desires and then we fire up that SSH command. We made the connection, but in a flash, we got unceremoniously booted out.  
We got ourselves a connection puzzle to solve.

As we all know, SSH requires a shell to operate. To discover the default shell for a user, you can turn to the good old '/etc/passwd'. There we go the answer to our conundrum lies in that little file. The default shell for our current user isn't the familiar bash; it's a peculiar file named 'showtext' lurking in '/user/bin/showtext'. 

We make our way to this mysterious location and unveil the secrets of 'showtext'. It turns out, it's a script that opens a file named 'text.txt' using a program called 'more'. But what's 'more,' you may ask? It's not just any command; it's a tool that lets you interactively display large files. When the content exceeds the terminal windows capacity, 'more' comes to the rescue. And here's the interesting part: 'more' has a hidden command up its sleeve - 'v'. This little gem launches the 'vim' text editor. 
Now, for those not familiar with 'vim', it's not just a text editor; it's a powerhouse that can execute shell commands. Personally, I don't like 'vim' that much, for me it's more work. However, I learned some basic commands that help me to use them in an emergency. In this challenge. we are going to wield 'vim' to break free from our restricted environment and summon a proper shell. 

The answer to the puzzle is now within our grasp. All that's left is to put the plan into action. But wait, what's this? An unexpected hurdle.

To activate 'more' you need to ensure there's not enough space to display the data. The easiest way? shrink your command window. It's a simple trick that works like a charm. 

With 'more' in action, we press 'v' and step into 'vim'. Now we can access another file with ':e' 
we find the bandit26 password in '/etc/bandit_pass/bandit26'. With the password in hand, we are one step closer. But we are not quite there yet. We try  ':shell' and we're still stuck in 'more'. The solution? Back to 'vim' we go, and this time, we command 'set shell=/bin/bash'. Finally, Shell sets us free, and we have cracked the challenge. 

This challenge was a roller-coaster of learning and problem-solving. It all began with understanding the elusive 'more' command, which was a game-changer. I admit, that I had to try various methods and do a bit of research, but eventually, I cracked it. 

For those who find this daunting, don't worry. I will be uploading a video to explain the process in more detail. so don't lose hope, keep trying, and remember, every failure is just a step toward success.
