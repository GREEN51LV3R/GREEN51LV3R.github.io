## PART 1: The Tool - LOOKSNIFF 

**LOOKSNIFF** is a powerful Python-based packet sniffer designed to capture and analyze network traffic. Specifically, it focuses on extracting valuable data like HTTP requests and login credentials from the traffic it intercepts. This tool provides options to log captured data, send real-time alerts, and display raw packet information. It’s perfect for learning about network traffic and improving your network security analysis skills.
### Features

- **HTTP Request Capture:** Monitors network traffic to capture HTTP requests and login credentials.
- **Data Logging:** Allows you to log the captured packets to a file for later analysis.
- **Alerts:** Sends email and desktop notifications when sensitive information, such as login details, is detected.
- **Network Interface Info:** Displays a list of network interfaces along with their corresponding IP and MAC addresses for easy interface selection.

> Warning : This tool is intended solely for educational use. Unauthorized monitoring of network traffic without consent is both illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have the proper permissions before using LOOKSNIFF on any network. The author assumes no responsibility for any consequences or misuse of this tool. Use at your own risk.

### Requirements

Before you get started, make sure you have the following:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- The necessary Python libraries, which are listed in the **requirements.txt** file.

### Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:** Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the LOOKSNIFF repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GREEN51LV3R/looksniff.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
`cd looksniff`
```

3. **Install the required Python libraries:** Install all necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
```

### Usage

Once you’ve set up the tool, you can start it by following these steps:

1. **Run the script:** Execute the following command:

```bash
`sudo python looksniff.py`
```

2. **Follow the prompts:** The script will prompt you to select options for logging, alerting, and selecting your network interface. Choose the appropriate options based on your needs.

### Configuration

#### **Email Alerts**

To enable email alerts when sensitive data is captured, you need to configure your email settings within the script. Below is a sample configuration for sending email notifications:

```bash
def send_email_alert(message):
    try:
        from_address = "your_email@example.com"
        to_address = "recipient_email@example.com"
        subject = "Sensitive Information Detected"
        msg = MIMEText(message)
        msg["Subject"] = subject
        msg["From"] = from_address
        msg["To"] = to_address

        server = smtplib.SMTP("smtp.example.com", 587)
        server.starttls()
        server.login("your_email@example.com", "your_password")
        server.sendmail(from_address, to_address, msg.as_string())
        server.quit()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send email: {e}")

```

Replace the placeholders with your own email credentials and SMTP server details.

#### **Desktop Notifications**

LOOKSNIFF also supports desktop notifications, which can be enabled using the **plyer** library. Make sure this library is properly installed by running:

```bash
pip install plyer
```

### Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError:** If you see this error, ensure that all required libraries are installed. You can install them by running:
```bash
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
```

- **Permission Issues:** If you encounter permission errors, make sure you have the necessary rights to access network interfaces. You may need to run the script as an administrator or root user.
    
- **Email Alerts Not Sending:** If email alerts aren’t working, double-check your email settings in the script. Verify the SMTP server, port, and email credentials. Additionally, check your email account for any security settings that may block less secure apps from sending emails.
