Recently I started doing OverTheWire Capture The Flag (CTF). My quest began with the simple Bandit challenges, seemingly straightforward at first glance. Armed with nothing but Linux commands and a handful of tools, I started exploring the world of Bandit CTF, where the initial levels were like warm-up exercises. 
But wait, don't be too quick to judge! While these challenges might have seemed simple, they were laying the foundation for something greater.
Sure, I won't pretend that I was breaking a sweat with each challenge, but these seemingly easy wins were a blessing in disguise. They were my gateway into the depths of Linux commands and essential tools. They forced me to understand these tools inside out, peeling back layers of complexity I never knew existed.

As I progressed, something magical happened. What was once simple challenges are turning into an enchanting puzzle. 

I decided to capture this magic by taking notes. And here's the twist: I locked these notes behind a mental vault. A vault I could only open when I was back at the same challenge, facing it like an old nemesis. After all, if I couldn't remember the problem, I definitely wouldn't remember the solution! But then, a brilliant idea struck – why not share this adventure with the world? That's when the concept of a blog post emerged.

 I knew it might not reach the masses, but that didn't matter. It was a documentation of my conquest, a peek into my world of hacks and hunches. Now, you might be wondering, why share but not solve? The answer is simple – this blog is a bridge between my discoveries and fellow cybersecurity enthusiasts. If you're treading the same path and stumble upon my musings, consider it a helping hand. While I can't promise solutions for every challenge, the ones I do share are carefully selected to aid you on your own quest. To those brave souls walking this path with me, a heartfelt 'thank you.' 

Your companionship is cherished. And yes, to the flag-hunters who might visit and leave empty-handed, remember that every challenge is a step toward mastery. There's beauty in not knowing it all – it leaves room for growth, curiosity, and a dash of adventure. And so, dear reader, let's delve into the heart of it. Let me take you on a wild ride through one particular challenge: Bandit 24, the gateway to Bandit 25.

### Unraveling Bandit 24 - The Locked Gate

Level Goal 

> A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret   numeric 4-digit PIN code. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing. You do not need to create new connections each time.

The suspense builds as we stand at the threshold of this challenge. Our journey begins with a secure shell connection, a key to a world of possibilities. And remember, just like in life, you can't skip levels here. Each challenge completed unlocks the next, a trail of digital breadcrumbs leading to greater glory. 

But oh, the temptation of quick fixes! I've resisted the urge to turn to walkthroughs, for in that temptation lies mediocrity. True art lies in understanding the complexity of each problem and embracing the struggle as part of the process.

As I connect to port 30002, I encounter a puzzling message: "I am the pin code checker for user Bandit 25. Please enter the password for user Bandit 24 and the secret PIN code on a single line, separated by a space."

Easier said than done, right? what is the catch here?

The catch is that the pin code is a 4-digit, hidden within the depths of 0000 to 9999. Trial and error is the name of the game, and manually entering each possibility would be a fool's errand.

Enter the script – a companion in code that tirelessly replaces PINs and waits for the magical moment. My script, my digital sidekick, relentlessly attempts each PIN in a dance of digital whispers. It's a race against time.

And yes, it takes longer than expected, but as lines of code run, my fingers find solace in typing away the tale you're now reading. So, here I am, basking in the glow of my screen, pouring out this narrative as my script works its magic. In the end, it's not just about finding the flag, it's about the journey, the process, and the thrill of conquering the unknown.
